<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A meticulous and methodical engineering student, Rajan Raj @rajanraj_2, holds a deep fascination for all things coding and the perpetual evolution of web development. Unflinchingly dedicated, he religiously sticks to a "100 days of code" challenge, each day tackling a complex problem that catapults him into a whirlwind of AI/ML, open-source software, and web development. Often using LeetCode and Coding Ninjas, he dances back and forth between the realms of frontend and backend technology.

<p> Rajan's tweets bullet a staccato beat that underscores the consistent rhythm of his odyssey; each tweet a marker along the path of his explorationâ€”an incessant march. Emotive Unicode symbols and hashtags pepper his prose, blending personality with information in a condensed micro-blog format. Rajan occasionally surfaces from the sea of code to share quirky programming humor or offer resources to his followers, injecting brief moments of levity and communal engagement into his otherwise focused narrative; a legacy written in Javascript and webbed intricacies.</p>
